# FEATURE-pHLA
## Physio-chemical features is all you need!
### Overview
We present FEATURE-pHLA. A tree-based model utilizing the physico-chemical fingerprints obtained from peptides and HLA sequences to predict pHLA binding affinity. To determine the predictive capabilities in physio-chemical features and explaining the mechanisms underlying the binding process. Below is the Framework of FEATURE-pHLA
