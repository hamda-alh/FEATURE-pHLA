# FEATURE-pHLA
## Physio-chemical features is all you need!
### Overview
We present FEATURE-pHLA. A tree-based model utilizing the physico-chemical fingerprints obtained from peptides and HLA sequences to predict pHLA binding affinity. To determine the predictive capabilities in physio-chemical features and explaining the mechanisms underlying the binding process. Below is the Framework of FEATURE-pHLA

## 

## Data:
Source data is aquired from (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zx3kjzc3yx/3) 

## 1. Feature Extraction
To extract list the list of physio-chemical features of the peptide and HLA sequences run [pHLA_data.ipynb](Script/pHLA_data.ipynb)
